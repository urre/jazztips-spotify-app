# Jazztips Spotify App

This is the Jazztips Spotify App that never got released.

In the App, users can read album reviews from [Jazztips](http://jazzti.ps), listen to those great jazz albums and save the music as playlists.

### FAQ

#### Can I install the app through the App finder?

No, sorry. Right after this app was submitted, [Spotify announced](http://devnews.spotify.com/2014/03/24/closure-of-spotify-apps-submissions/) that they will not be accepting any new submissions for Spotify apps for release in the App Finder.

Maybe there will be some kind of new Jazztips app in the future. Meanwhile, check out [some great music]([Jazztips](http://jazzti.ps)).
